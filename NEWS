New features as implemented in version 1.7.13:

    Most notably structure highlighting, the quality of which, I'm quite
    found about!

    Many manu numerious bug fixes.
    
    Cross file note support.

    Compleatly rewhamped graphical appearence. This is the prof of my
    personal taste in those matters ;-).
    
    Overall code quality improvements.
    
    Checked the command line options -file and -path. Both are working
    now the desirable way, allowing to open arbitrar Top node files from
    the command line.
