The program does not display accented characters correctly. 
This is likely due to assuming an ASCII or ISO-8859 8 bit charset. 

Unicode characters are thus shown as graphical characters.

Attempting to replace XDrawString with Xutf8DrawString results in miserable
failure. Xutf8DrawString depends on an XFontSet returned by XCreateFontSet, but calls to that function whatever the font name end with SIGSEGV.

It may be better to rewrite the whole do_draw functions to use
only Motif 2.x render tables and eliminate the low level Xlib.
