	* Bookmark menu support added. Tought, we don't preserve the
	bookmark list between different sessions.
	
	* Added and the ability to open files in place! Once again the
	strtok() libc call hase proven itself to be usefull for nothing...

	* Added notes about -file and -path command line options to the
	Help menu.

Tue Oct 28 02:10:04 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki

	file references as well as node names for those files.

Sun Oct 26 15:09:02 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki

	* Luxury highlighting of itemized lists.
	
	* Distinctive colors for links visited during that session and
	for links not already visited.

Sat Oct 25 23:15:35 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki

	* Cross file note support. There that many new features/bugfixes,
	that we should consider it to bump the version to 2.xx
	
	* Luxury highlighting of notes and menu points.
	
	* Display foonote bar instead of the ugly text.

	* Fixed case of drwing middle chunk of highlighted xref/menu.
	
	* Use preparsed information about indirections in the handling of
	clicks in the display area instead of on the fly parsing the text
	content. Much more reliable now!

Fri Oct 24 01:16:03 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki

	* First structutre highlighting imlpemented for notes ans menu
	points. This is really worth it!

Thu Oct 23 19:55:01 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki 

	* Finally found the way, how to implement custom highlighting
	in Motif's text widget. We are doing it now, by substituting an
	corresponding routine pointer in the text display widget record.
	
	As of current we used this only to imelpemnt reasonable
	highlighting of slections. More will follow soon.
	
	* Preserving of the original position implemented between wolks on
	the pages. Slowly but surely, we bacame really THE reader of
	choice.

Thu Aug 21 19:11:54 MET DST 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Tip help technology takover from the me2 project. Finally this
	is the clean way to implement it :-).

	* Take over of the PixmapButton creation technology from the me2 
	project.

	* Take over switched tool bars technology from me2 project.
	
	* Adjust general look to be more CDE alike. Sorry I don't have CDE
	on my developement engine itself. Therefore it isn't possible for
	me to make this app really CDE compilant :-(.

	If somebody would be so kind to donate CDE for Linux to me...

	* Moved alot of String settings into reosurces for easier
	internationalization.
	
	* Added poopup menu to the display area.

Mon Jun  9 19:41:47 MET DST 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Fixed problems in finding info nodes which are registered as
	(bla) in the topmost dir directory, but which are installed as
	bla.info.gz. Many thank's to anybody who pointed me at this
	oversight!!! Esp.:  Thomas M. Ott, ...

Tue Apr 22 01:36:35 MET DST 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Improved handling of pixmaps taken over from the medit project.
	There shuldn't be any problems with the colormap handling in 
	"cooperation" with humble colormap eaters like netscape for
	example anymore.

	* Properly override the translations for osfUp and osfDown to get
	the right behaviour for an display only text widget.

Mon Apr 14 09:40:48 MET DST 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Clicking in the main window correctly implemented by hooking
	into the corresponding button press event instead of the ugly
	motion verify callback! Push the version number once again. This
	is an important step.

Thu Apr 10 10:00:14 MET DST 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* First really working version of tip code inserted.
	
Thu Apr 10 02:10:17 MET DST 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Warning cleanup. Started with tip-code on the button bar.

Sun Apr  6 16:16:54 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Protoize all. New string list utility routines
	create_XmString_list() and free_XmString_list().

Mon Jan 13 22:05:43 MET 1997 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Resizing of the status text works now. Center the about message
	lines.

Tue Dec 17 00:08:15 MET 1996 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Fixed an bug in the file_cache handing during the lookup of
	nodes.

Thu Dec 12 03:03:40 MET 1996 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Searching is working now!

Wed Dec 11 20:45:15 MET 1996 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Made lookup_node_in_file() from file_ops.c recursion save.

Wed Dec 11 01:35:15 MET 1996  Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Hah! the Open File menu option is functional now!

Tue Dec 10 19:12:38 MET 1996 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Undo the usage of XmString for the location label. It is better
	to do  it the same way like in netsacpe.

	* Use the motionVerify callback for clicking through menus. (It's
	far better to don't have cursor movements in the text instead of
	the  creazy multiclicking. Position the cursor on the scrollbar if
	You  want cursor scrolling. Tough someboby with long enought
	breath could  find the corresponding resource settings needed to
	make them come  back.

Tue Dec 10 01:43:45 MET 1996 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Fixed a reference to NULL pointer in files_ops.
	
	* Try to extend file names in file indirected nodes by .info in
	case of failure, just to cover some more wired cases.

	* Use a XmString label with an corresponding border for the
	displaying of the location.

	* Add an search button. Currently without functionality.
	
	* Make Open File work.

Sat Dec  7 02:37:19 MET 1996 Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@sub994.sub.uni-goettingen.de>

	* Corrected the handling of clipping in the icon creation.

	* Some significant code duplication reduction.
