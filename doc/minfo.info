1 Introduction
**************

This document describes `minfo' version 1.7.16. This is the second
sound official release of this program. After the encouragement from the
people which where already using the previous releases, I decided before
about two weeks to spend some more significant time on this project.

   Most notably I gained (IMHO) a lot more expierence in Motif/Xt/X11
programming in general. Much of this came from the excellent test
program set provided with the still onging free Motif clone called
lesstif.

   Further on there are some other non free projects I was doing in
parallel, where much of the technics where borrowed from ofter
discovering them.

   The main new features are:

  1. Various bugfixes;

  2. Compleatly new look and feel. It's now not as close as possible to
     Mozialla-3.xx anylonger. Insted I implemented something what is
     suiting my personal taste little more.

     Before critisizing me for my taste, please bear in mind that I'm
     born _directly_ on the Baltic coast. Maybe therefore I preffer
     darkish metal blue shades :-).

  3. Unique technique for implementation of tips on buttons, which
     doesn't rely on the active status of those widgets and enter leave
     on events on the windows associated with theyr background. It's
     still not quite perfect, but at least the correct implementation
     road is shown.

  4. The button shape library is now much less of a mess then it used
     to be.  Most notably the background color of the buttons are now
     compleatly adaptive to the shape colors of the associated widget.

  5. I discovered finally a way how to manipulate the output drawing in
     plain Motif text widgets, without relying on features, which can
     be only found in the not widly accepted 2.0 of this tyranosaurus
     rex of software design blow.
